# Autogen migrated to Agentchat

Autogen released v0.4. Older version v0.2 was the one we used for initial tutorials. But considering that the changes between 0.2 and 0.4 are major including the package name itself, we will do the tutorials of 0.4 in a separate folder named **agentchat**

We will have new venv and requirements too.
